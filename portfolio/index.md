# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! It showcases five select projects I've done in my time at the University of Montana - Missoula as a Master's student in Computer Science. I suggest you start with my [self-reflection](./self-reflection/) or, if you prefer, just pick a project to start perusing.

<!-- ## Projects
Selected projects completed during my Master's degree:

<dl>
  {% for page in site.pages %}
    {% if page.summary %}
      <dt><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></dt>
      <dd>{{ page.summary }}</dd>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</dl> -->

## Committee
I am very thankful to my graduate portfolio advisor and our department chair, [Dr. Yolanda Reimer](http://www.cas.umt.edu/casweb/faculty/FacultyDetails.cfm?id=543).
